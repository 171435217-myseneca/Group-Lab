# Group-Lab

game.py is the python code for simulating "Rock,paper,scissors" game. At first, it asks the user to enter their option. The computer's choice is seleceted randomly. After that the code compares the coices. First it checks if they are the same or not. If yes, it finishes the gane as a tie if not if proceeds with comparing the user's choice and the computer's choice and announces that the user has won or lost.When the result is printed(eithwer is a tie or someone has won) the code will ask the user if they want to continue or not. This lab is done just by myself.
